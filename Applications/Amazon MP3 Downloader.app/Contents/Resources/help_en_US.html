<p>While the Amazon MP3 is compatible with the most commonly used Web browsers, you will need to configure your system and browser settings to allow downloads from Amazon.com to complete successfully.

</p><p><b>Shopping With Your Default Browser</b><br>

The Amazon MP3 Downloader works with your system's default Web browser. You may encounter issues initiating or completing your download if you use an alternate browser to shop Amazon MP3.</p>

<p>For example, if you install the Amazon MP3 Downloader using an alternate browser (e.g. Firefox) that is not your system's default browser (e.g. Internet Explorer), your default browser will launch after the Amazon MP3 Downloader installs and you will not be able to complete purchases from your alternate browser.</p>

<p><strong>To enable your preferred browser:</strong></p>
<ul><li><b>Set preferred Web browser as system default:</b> Please refer to your browser's Help section for information on designating it as your system's default browser. After your system is set to the preferred default browser, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200154260&amp;#install">install the Downloader</a>.<br><br></li>

<li><b>Enable Amazon MP3 Downloader for current browser:</b> If the Amazon MP3 Downloader is already installed on your system, visit the Amazon MP3 Downloader install page at <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/help/amd.html/">http://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/help/amd.html/</a> using your preferred Web browser and follow the instructions in the "Troubleshooting" section.</li></ul>


<p><b>Adjusting Your Browser Settings</b><br>
In certain cases, settings on your browser may be preventing your files from being downloaded to your computer. Please refer to your browser's Help section for specific instructions on adjusting your browser settings.

</p><ul>
<li><b>Enable Cookies:</b> The Amazon MP3 Downloader uses cookies to work with Amazon.com to confirm your purchases and manage your Amazon MP3 file downloads. You will need to enable your browser to accept cookies from Amazon.com to successfully download files. <br><br>If you do not enable cookies or only allow cookies temporarily by session, you may be asked to install the Amazon MP3 Downloader after each purchase. Always accepting cookies from Amazon.com will eliminate this type of issue.<br><br></li>

<li><b>Disable Pop-Up Blockers:</b> You should adjust your browser settings to allow pop-up windows from Amazon.com. The Amazon MP3 Downloader works with your default browser and will launch new windows to help you complete purchases and downloads.<br><br></li>

<li><b>Enable Downloads from Amazon.com:</b> You may need to add Amazon.com to your list of trusted sites or allow downloads from Amazon.com if your browser displays a security warning.<br><br></li>

<li><b>Enable Download Notifications:</b> In certain cases, your browser's security settings may be preventing file downloads without notifying you that a download is being attempted, particularly if you use Internet Explorer. Check your browser's security settings to enable automatic prompting for file downloads so you know if your browser is blocking downloads.</li>

</ul><p></p>

<a name="install"></a><p></p><b class="sans"><font color="#cc6600">Installing the Amazon MP3 Downloader</font></b><br>

<p>We'll automatically prompt you to install the Amazon MP3 Downloader when you make your first MP3 purchase.</p>

<p><b>To install the Amazon MP3 Downloader:</b></p>

<ol><li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/dmusic/help/amd.html/">Click here to visit the Amazon MP3 Downloader install page</a>.</li>
<li>Click the <b>Download Now</b> button for your operating system. (Your OS should be detected automatically.)</li>

<li>Follow the "Detailed Installation Instructions" on the Amazon MP3 Downloader install page.</li></ol>

<p><b>Testing The Downloader With Your Free Song</b><br>

We offer you a Free song after the Amazon MP3 Downloader installation completes so you can test the Amazon MP3 Downloader and make sure it is working. If you are installing the Downloader to complete your first MP3 purchase, the music you bought will download after the Free song.</p>

<p>Be sure to "Open" the .amz file if prompted and configure your settings to always use the Amazon MP3 Downloader to "Open" .amz files. The .amz file type activates the Downloader and initiates your MP3 file downloads.</p>

<p>After your free song downloads, the Amazon MP3 Downloader will open your iTunes or Windows Media Player (if you have either installed) and will automatically import the downloaded song so you can start listening to it. See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200154260&amp;#import">Importing into iTunes or Windows Media Player</a> for more information.</p>

<a name="use"></a><p></p><b class="sans"><font color="#cc6600">Using the Amazon MP3 Downloader</font></b><br>
<p>All content you buy from Amazon MP3 must be downloaded at the time of purchase. The Amazon MP3 Downloader streamlines the process of downloading and organizing the content you purchase by enabling you to download entire albums, queue up multiple song purchases, and automatically import content into iTunes or Windows Media Player.</p>

<p><b>Launching the Amazon MP3 Downloader</b><br>
The Downloader launches automatically each time you make a purchase. You will only need to launch the Amazon MP3 Downloader manually from your computer if you pause or cancel a download, or "Save" the .amz file to your computer instead of opening it with the Amazon MP3 Downloader.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Downloads are only available for a short time after purchase. If you saved the .amz file to your computer, you should "Open" it using the Downloader application immediately after saving it. If you wait to complete your download, it may expire and no longer be available.</p>

<p>Here's where to find and launch the Amazon MP3 Downloader application if you need to resume an incomplete download:
</p><ul><li><b>Windows:</b> All Programs &gt; Amazon &gt; Amazon MP3 Downloader</li>

<li><b>Mac:</b> Select "Amazon MP3 Downloader" from your Applications folder.</li>
<li><b>Linux:</b> The application is installed as /usr/bin/amazonmp3 and an icon appears in the "Applications" menu in the "Internet" submenu.</li></ul><p></p>

<p><b>Amazon MP3 Downloader Command Buttons</b><br>
When a download is in progress, the commands listed below will be available depending on the items downloading and their status. If a command is not available for the selected item, the button will be grayed out.</p>

<ul><li><b>Pause Downloads:</b> Pauses the download of all albums or songs if any downloads are in progress. Paused items will be available in the Amazon MP3 Downloader even if you close and restart the application, but we do not recommend pausing downloads unless you plan to resume the downloads within 3 hours. If you have difficulty resuming paused downloads, please contact Customer Support.<br><br></li>

<li><b>Resume Downloads:</b> Resumes downloading any previously paused songs.<br><br></li>

<li><b>Clear Completed:</b> Removes downloaded albums and songs from the download window. If a download was incomplete because you chose to cancel or pause it, selecting this option will not remove those items from your download list. All completed downloads will clear when you close the application.<br><br></li>

<li><b>Open Selected:</b> Launches your default media player and plays the selected song. If an album is selected, choosing this option will open the Amazon MP3 folder so you can choose from available content.<br><br></li>

<li><b>"View Downloads":</b> The available option varies depending on your operating system.


<ul><li>View Download Folder (Windows)</li>
<li>Reveal in Finder (Mac)</li>
<li>View Download Folder (Linux)</li>
</ul>

<p>Opens the default download folder where your Amazon MP3 purchases are stored on your computer. The default folder is "Amazon MP3" on your computer. This will typically appear in your "My Music" folder (Windows) or your "Music" folder (Mac). See <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=200154260&amp;#locate">Locating Downloaded Songs</a> for more information.

<a name="download_steps"></a><h2>Downloading MP3 files from Your Media Library</h2>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/library">Your Media Library</a>
</li><li>Log in, if prompted.
</li><li>Click on the "Downloads" tab.
</li><li>Hover over the arrow on the "Downloads" tab and choose "Amazon MP3" from the pop-up menu. (This will filter the results so only your music downloads are displayed).
</li><li>Find the album in the list and click on the "Download" button to display songs available for download. If you purchased only one song, Your Media Library will still display your purchases by the album the song is from.
</li><li>On the album detail page, click the "Download" link next to each song available to start the download.
</li><li>If you have the Amazon MP3 Downloader installed, choose the option to open the .amz file when prompted.

</li></ol>


<a name="import"></a><p></p><b class="sans"><font color="#cc6600">Importing into iTunes or Windows Media Player</font></b><br>

<p>If you have iTunes or Windows Media Player installed on your computer, the Amazon MP3 Downloader will automatically launch the application designated as the default media player and import your content into your library. If neither application is installed, the Amazon MP3 Downloader will simply save the downloads to your default Download Folder.</p>

<p><b>Note:</b> The media library import function is not available for the Linux version of the Amazon MP3 Downloader.</p>

<p><b>To set the default importing behavior:</b>
</p><ol><li>Launch the Amazon MP3 Downloader.</li>
<li>Select "File/Preferences . . ." from the Amazon MP3 Downloader menu.</li>
<li>Choose the desired default player under the "Media Library" section. Choose "Do nothing" if you do not wish to use the import function.</li>

</ol>

<p>The options for "Add it to iTunes" or "Add it to Windows Media Player" will only appear if those applications are installed on your computer system.</p>

<p><b>A Note about Using iTunes</b><br>
In certain rare cases, the Downloader may fail to import songs into iTunes due to potential issues with the installed version of iTunes. The Downloader should provide a message in the right-hand corner of your screen that it failed to add songs to iTunes. If this occurs, we recommended you visit www.iTunes.com and install the most recent version of the application. After reinstalling iTunes, please restart your computer, launch iTunes, and accept Apple's terms of use before attempting to use the Amazon MP3 Downloader to import songs to iTunes.

</p><p>You may also wish to add your Amazon MP3 Downloader's Download Folder to your iTunes settings. To do this, launch iTunes and select the "Add Folder to Library" option from the menu and select the folder to which your songs download. The default folder is called "Amazon MP3" and resides in the "My Music" folder in Windows or the "Music" folder on a Mac.</p>

<a name="locate"></a><p></p><b class="sans"><font color="#cc6600">Locating Downloadeds</font></b><br>

<p>When the Amazon MP3 Downloader saves content to your computer, it saves them to a folder called "Amazon MP3" by default. This folder is located within the "My Music" folder in Windows or the "Music" folder on a Mac. We recommend using the default folder, but you can change this setting if you wish.</p>

<p>If you did not use the Amazon MP3 Downloader to save your content, you can find files by searching for ".mp3" on your computer or by checking the default save location for your Web browser.</p>

<p>To find your videos in Windows Media Player, click on the downward facing arrow below “Library” in the top center of the application and select “”Video” form the drop down.  You should now see the videos downloaded by the Amazon MP3 Downloader.  Digital booklets are not downloaded into Windows Media Player and are instead saved to your default download folder.</p>

<p><b>To change the default Amazon MP3 Downloader save location:</b>

</p><ol><li>Launch the Amazon MP3 Downloader.</li>
<li>Select "File/Preferences . . ." from the Amazon MP3 Downloader menu.</li>
<li>Click the <b>Change</b> button in the Download Folder section.</li>
<li>Select a folder from the list.</li>
<li>If you wish to create a subfolder inside the selected folder, click the <b>Make New Folder</b> button.</li>

<li>Click the <b>OK</b> button when finished.</li>
